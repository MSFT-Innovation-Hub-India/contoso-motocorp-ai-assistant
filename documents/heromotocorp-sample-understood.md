## ACCESSORIES & MODIFICATIONS

Modifying your vehicle or using non-Hero
MotoCorp accessories can make your vehicle
unsafe. Before you consider making any
modifications or adding an accessory, be sure
to read the following information.


### ! WARNING

· Improper accessories or modifications can
cause a crash in which you can be seriously
hurt or killed.

· Follow all instructions in this owner's manual
regarding accessories and modifications.


#### Accessories

. Make sure that the accessory does not
obscure any lamps, reduce ground
clearance, limit suspension travel or steering
travel, affect your riding position or interfere
with operating any controls.

· Be sure electrical equipment does not
exceed the vehicle's electrical system
capacity (page 6). A blown fuse can cause a
loss of lights.

· Do not pull a trailer or sidecar with your
vehicle. This vehicle was not designed for
these attachments, and their use can
seriously impair your vehicle's handling.


#### Modifications

We strongly advise you not to remove any
original equipment or modify your vehicle in
any way that would change its design or

operation. Such changes could seriously
impair your vehicle's handling, stability and
braking, making it unsafe to ride. Removing or
modifying your lamps, mufflers, emission
control system or other equipment can also
make your vehicle illegal.


#### ANTI-THEFT TIPS

· Always lock the steering and never leave the
key in the ignition switch. This sounds
simple but people do forget.

· Be sure the registration information for your
vehicle is accurate and correct.

· Park your vehicle in a locked garage
whenever possible.

· Use an additional anti-theft device of good
quality.

· Never park your vehicle in an isolated area.
Park as far as possible in a designated area.

· Keep a note in your vehicle all the time with
your name, address and contact details.

# VEHICLE SAFETY IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Your vehicle can provide many years of
service and pleasure if you take responsibility
for your own safety and understand the
challenges you can meet on the road.

There is much that you can do to protect
yourself when you ride. You will find many
helpful recommendations throughout this
manual. Following are a few that we consider
most important.


## Always wear a helmet

It is a proven fact, helmet significantly reduces
the number and severity of head injuries. So
always wear a helmet and make sure your
pillion rider does the same. We also
recommend that you wear eye protection,
sturdy boots, gloves and other protective gear.


## Before riding your vehicle

Make sure that you are physically fit, mentally
focused and free of alcohol and drugs. Check
that you and your pillion are both wearing an
approved vehicle helmet and protective
apparel. Instruct your pillion on holding onto
the grab rail or your waist, leaning with you in
turns, and keeping their feet on the footrest,
even when the vehicle is stopped.


## Take time to learn & practice your vehicle

Even if you have ridden other vehicles,
practice riding in a safe area to become
familiar with how this vehicle works and
handles, and to become accustomed to the
vehicle's size and weight.


## Ride defensively

Always pay due attention to other vehicles
around you, and do not assume that other
drivers see you. Be prepared to stop quickly or
perform an evasive maneuver.


## Make yourself easily visible

Some drivers do not see vehicles because they
are not looking for them. To make yourself more
visible, wear bright reflective clothing, position
yourself so that others can see you, signal before
turning or changing lanes, and use horn which
will help others to notice you.


## Ride within your limits

Pushing the limits is another major cause of
vehicle accidents. Never ride beyond your
personal abilities or faster than conditions
demand. Remember that fatigue and
negligence can significantly reduce your ability
to make good judgements and ride safely.


## Do not drink and ride

Riding under the influence of alcohol or drugs
is dangerous. Alcohol can reduce your ability
to respond to changing conditions and reduce
the reaction time. Do not drink and ride.


## Keep your vehicle in safe condition

For safe riding, it's important to inspect your
vehicle before every ride and perform all
recommended maintenance. Never exceed
load limits, and use accessories that have been
recommended by Hero MotoCorp for this
vehicle.

<!-- PageNumber="8" -->

## If you are involved in a crash

Personal safety is your first priority. If you or
anyone else has been injured, take time to
assess the severity of the injuries and whether
it is safe to continue riding. Call for emergency
assistance if needed. Also follow applicable
laws and regulations if another person or
vehicle is involved in the crash.

!
WARNING

· Not wearing a helmet increases the chance of
serious injury or death in a crash.

. Be sure you and your pillion always wear a
helmet, eye protection and other protective
apparel when you ride.
